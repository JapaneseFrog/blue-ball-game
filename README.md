## Contributor Log
- Tom is really on a mad one right now, he's deleted all of my files and everything. I am very unhappy. Don't worry though guys, I have all the real original (not Tom) files on my personal computer, so if he really messes it up I can still restore everything to the REAL version of the game. Happy Balling! - from JF

- ITS ALL STILL AVALIABLE ON THE RELEASE STOP CRYING - from tom

- Seriously doubting this project now, all of these contributors are doing my head in, I don't even know why they're called contributors, they only seem to contribute to doing my head in!!! To be fair, thriller is a very nice contributor who got access to this repository through pure guile. P.S. People officially prefer the original pre-release to Tom's silly new one! -JF
